In this homework assignment, we were asked to create a weather dashboard using OpenWeatherMap's API. When the user searches for a city by name, they are presented with the current weather in that city. The application displays the date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The UV index's background changes from green, to yellow, to red depending on the severity of the UV rays.
<br><br>
Below the information about the current weather, the user is also presented with a five-day forecast. Each day in the forecast displays the date, an icon that shows what weather to expect, the temperature, and the humidity.
<br><br>
Once a city has been searched, it is added to a search history list that appears underneath the search bar.
